    "A modified Hazardous Situation ODP (Ontology Design Pattern) is a refined version of the existing pattern that enhances its ability to support risk assessment and mitigation planning. This modification focuses on breaking down aspects of exposure to a hazard into individual components, allowing for a more granular understanding of the impact on different objects and people.\n",

    "Existing Hazardous Situation ODP:\n",
    "The original pattern effectively addresses core competency questions related to hazard exposure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modified pattern expands on the original by:\n",
    "- Breaking down exposure components: This allows for a more precise analysis of how different objects and individuals are affected by the same hazard. \n",
    "- Supporting risk assessment and mitigation: The modified pattern enables a more comprehensive approach to identifying and addressing potential hazards. \n",
    "- Considering individual susceptibility: The modification acknowledges that different entities (objects, people, etc.) may be impacted differently by the same hazard due to their unique characteristics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Key Benefit:\n",
    "- The modified pattern helps in identifying and addressing potential hazards more effectively by considering the specific context of each situation. \n"
